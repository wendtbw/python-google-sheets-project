# python-google-sheets-project

Tokyo Python Society Project Night Project for 26 May Wed evening 7.30pm.

Idea for the base of the project:

Create a python script that automatically updates Google sheets with ticker data from some finacial exchanges.

Some Psudo-coding to get basic steps:

1. Create a google sheets template that will display the financial data.
2. Communicate with an API to retrieve required data.
3. Enter the data into the Google spreadsheet.
4. other steps I am missing?


Other ideas if time permits;
- create graph with the data.
- Some type of ranking system or ordering system of assets
